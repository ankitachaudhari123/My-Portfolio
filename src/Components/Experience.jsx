                In my current role at DMSTech, I've accrued over a year of invaluable experience, during which I've made substantial contributions to numerous projects. Notably, I've played a pivotal role in the creation of over five websites, including noteworthy projects like Furniture and a Farm House Website. 
                <br/> 
                In addition to my website development duties, I've diversified my skill set by mastering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and Ajax. 
                <br/>
                 By harnessing these technologies, I've engineered captivating frontend experiences for a multitude of websites.
                <br/>
                 Moreover, I've broadened my expertise by constructing websites with comprehensive backend functionality, showcasing my proficiency across the entire development spectrum. 
                <br/>
                Presently, I'm proactively honing my abilities by delving into React, with a particular emphasis on advancing my prowess in backend development.
